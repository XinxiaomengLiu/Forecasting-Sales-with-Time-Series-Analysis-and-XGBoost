# Forecasting-Sales-with-Time-Series-Analysis-and-XGBoost

Accurately predicting future sales is crucial for inventory management, product production, and operational decision-making. Time series forecasting primarily relies on historical data to infer future sales trends. While traditional time series models like ARIMA and SARIMA can capture temporal patterns effectively, they often fall short when dealing with multidimensional features and complex patterns. On the other hand, XGBoost, as an ensemble learning method, excels in handling nonlinear problems and multidimensional features, making it a powerful tool for time series forecasting.

In this work, I present a comprehensive solution for sales forecasting by integrating XGBoost with time series models. Using a simulated sales dataset enriched with real-world business features such as weather, promotions, and holidays, I leverage XGBoost and PyTorch to perform time series predictions. This study demonstrates the end-to-end workflow, from data generation, preprocessing, and feature engineering to model development, visualization, and optimization.
